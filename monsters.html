        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The Skull</h2>
        <p>
            A powerful monster — he is a big, walking skull 💀. He can throw smaller skulls that act like cameras to track players.
            When you see one, <strong>break it immediately</strong> using any available tool and hide! If you don’t,
            he will track and find you. Once you break a skull, he will come to check the area, so stay hidden!

    <div class="textBox">
        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Gooler 👻</h2>
        <p>
            A shadowy, black ghost that only appears in dark rooms devoid of any light. Gooler attempts to possess your body, dealing significant damage if successful. He is <strong> extremely sensitive </strong> to light—if you sense his presence nearby, immediately light up the room before he enters your body.

    <div class="textBox">
        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The Grafted 🪓</h2>
        <p>
            A horrifying fusion of corpses dragged from graveyards, stitched together by dark magic bound to a cursed axe. This abomination wields multiple melee weapons with its many arms, while one massive hand grips the magical axe that gave it life. The Grafted is extremely powerful and cannot be taken down without enhancements or boosts. However, it has a known weakness—<b>fire</b>. Stay alert; its attacks are brutal, fast, and unpredictable.

    <div class="textBox">
        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Corpseweaver 🕷️</h2>
        <p>
            A grotesque spider-shaped abomination, formed from a tangled mass of rotting corpses. The Corpseweaver skitters unnaturally fast, relentlessly chasing down its prey. It’s incredibly deadly—if it reaches you, there’s no escape. Fire is its only known weakness, so light it up before it gets too close.
