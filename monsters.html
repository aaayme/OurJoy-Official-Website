        <h2>🧪 Doctor Herbert</h2>
        <p>
            You will fight this boss at the end of Chapter 1. He appears inside a heavily-armored robot equipped with multiple weapons. The robot itself is invulnerable to direct damage due to its powerful armor.

            <br><br>
            To defeat him, you must destroy his energy sources: <b>4 main batteries</b> located on his back and <b>2 hidden generators</b> somewhere in the room.

            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 1:</b> The boss uses two guns attached to his arms and two grenade launchers mounted on his shoulders.

            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 2:</b> After two batteries are destroyed, he switches tactics—pulling a sword from his back, powering it up, and now attacking with three weapons at once.

            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 3:</b> Once the last two batteries are destroyed, he activates the hidden generators and unleashes two powerful laser cannons.

            <br><br>
            When all power sources are finally destroyed, he releases a sleeping gas that knocks out all players. This marks the end of Chapter 1.

            <h2>The Grafted</h2>
            <p>
                You will encounter this boss in <b>Chapter 2</b>. After finally reaching the surface, players find themselves in a mysterious graveyard filled with medieval weapons. Among them lies an unusual axe. Soon, body parts from various corpses begin crawling toward it—assembling into a horrific being known as <b>The Grafted</b>.

                <br><br>
                <b>Phase 1:</b> The Grafted uses four main attacks:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Axe Slash:</b> Charges at a player with the axe dragging along the ground, then unleashes a heavy slash.</li>
                <li><b>Multi-Hands Slam:</b> Slams all of his hands into the ground while walking forward, damaging everything in his path.</li>
                <li><b>Axe Waving:</b> Swings his axe in wide arcs, generating wind-based attacks. This move has two variants:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rolls toward the player and performs a downward axe smash.</li>
                        <li>Throws three wind waves from a distance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Ground Pound:</b> Lifts his axe and slams it into the ground, creating a shockwave.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <b>Phase 2:</b> Upon reaching low health, he strikes the ground three times, causing the arena floor to collapse. Both the boss and the players fall into a new underground arena with <b>4 fire launchers</b>.

            <br><br>
            A plant-like creature merges with The Grafted, mutating him further. His arms gain the ability to stretch, allowing a fifth attack that has extended reach. He also becomes immune to normal damage.

            <br><br>
            The only way to hurt him now is to <b>lure him into the fire launchers</b>. Players must time it right—activating the nearest fire trap when he's close. But watch out—standing too close risks burning yourself.

            <br><br>
            When his health hits zero, The Grafted begins to burn and violently rolls to the center of the arena. Suddenly, a giant <b>Skeleworm</b>
            bursts from beneath the ground, grabs the burning boss in its jaws, and disappears into the depths.
