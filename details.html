    <b>General Info</b><br>
    A team of 1 to 8 players begins in the surgery room, trying to find the exit. Along the way, they must survive through 100 rooms, including 4 puzzle rooms, 2 boss rooms, and a terrifying chase sequence.

    <br><br>
    Players can collect evidence throughout their run to earn cash, which can be used to buy new abilities and starting items.

    <br><br>
    <b>Game Type:</b> Co-op Survival Horror / Puzzle Adventure
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Room Types</b><br>
    There are 3 types of rooms:
    <ul>
      <li>Normal Rooms</li>
      <li>Puzzle Rooms</li>
      <li>Boss Rooms</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Normal Rooms</b><br>
    they are randomly placed between puzzle rooms and boss rooms. Some are uniqueâ€”such as the starting room. They may be dark or well-lit, and you may encounter common monsters inside.
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Puzzle Rooms</b><br>
    Unique rooms where each one contains a different puzzle. Players must solve the puzzle to unlock the door to the next room. Some puzzle rooms may be dark, and monsters might appear to interrupt the solving process.
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Boss Rooms</b><br>
    Special rooms featuring unique boss fights. Some boss rooms may also include puzzles that must be solved to defeat the boss or to survive the encounter.
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Player Abilities</b><br>
    Each player has one unique ability, granted through an incomplete surgery performed by Dr. Herbert. The players escaped the surgery room before the operation was finished, so their abilities remain dormant.

    <br><br>
    To activate an ability temporarily, players must use a special item known as the <b>blue needle</b>. These needles are rare, so itâ€™s wise to save them for tough battles against strong monsters.

    <br><br>
    Later in the game, players can unlock a powerful <b>super ability</b> that requires the use of a <b>red needle</b>. Additionally, different abilities can be purchased from the shop.

  <div class="textBox">
    <h2>ðŸ§© Zombie's Trap Room</h2>
    <p>
      Players may come across rooms containing zombies locked behind glass. At first glance, they seem harmlessâ€”until one or more <strong>Eyes</strong> appear (especially the <span style="color:limegreen;">green eye</span>).
      <br><br>
      If any player makes direct eye contact with the green eye, the glass shatters, zombies are released, the room goes into lockdown, and an <strong>emergency alarm</strong> blares.
      <br><br>
      Worse yet, spotting the <span style="color:black; font-weight: bold">black eye</span> will cause the lights to explode, plunging the room into darkness and drawing in <strong>Goolers</strong>â€”turning it into a multi-threat ambush.
      <br><br>
      To stop the emergency, players must eliminate all zombies in the room. Temporary weapons will be scattered nearby for quick use.
      <br><br>
      Stay alert. Stay together. Avoid the eyesâ€”unless youâ€™re ready for the fight.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="textBox">
    <h2>ðŸ§© Gooler's Puzzle Room</h2>
    <p>
      A lever must be activated to proceed, but it's surrounded by Goolers, making it unreachable without dealing with them first.<br><br>

      In the center of the room stands a large light tower â€” currently turned off. It requires <strong>8 batteries</strong> to operate at full power. The players must search the area to find and insert these batteries into the tower.<br><br>

      Each battery placed increases the light level, expanding a safe zone around the tower where players can rest and plan. After placing 4 batteries, Goolers will begin targeting any players without a light source or with weak lighting tools.<br><br>

      When 6 batteries are installed, the elevator to the second floor will be powered. Upstairs, players can find the final 2 batteries, along with 2 optional extras. There are also 2 small light stands that can be powered for extra safe zones â€” though activating them is optional.<br><br>

      On the second floor, be cautious â€” Goolers can emerge from the ground.<br><br>

      Once all 8 batteries are placed in the main tower, the entire room will flood with light, instantly destroying all remaining Goolers and unlocking the exit door.<br><br>

      Expect many <strong>Gooler-B</strong> types and a few <strong>Gooler-A</strong> variants throughout this challenge.

    <h2>ðŸ©» Progression & Game Flow</h2>
    <p>
      The game begins in <strong>Room 0</strong>, a dim surgery room. Players will progress through rooms <strong>1 to 29</strong>, leading up to the first <strong>Zombie Trap Room (Easy)</strong>.
      <br><br>
      - If no one makes eye contact with a <span style="color:limegreen;"><strong>Green Eye</strong></span>, they can skip this trap. <br>
      - However, skipping means they miss out on getting a <strong>normal gun</strong>.
      <br><br>
      At <strong>Room 30</strong>, the <strong>Corpseweaver</strong> appears. Players must run from it through rooms up to <strong>Room 50</strong>. To escape:
    <ul>
      <li>They must cut the electricity to close the door and trap the Corpseweaver.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Doing so leads them to the <strong>Goolerâ€™s Puzzle Room</strong>. Solving it unlocks both the entrance and exit doors.
    <br><br>
    Players will have to <strong>run again from the Corpseweaver</strong> until they reach <strong>Room 55</strong>, where an elevator offers temporary escape.
    <br><br>
    In <strong>Rooms 65 to 75</strong>, they face another <strong>Zombie Trap Room (Hard)</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>Skipping this one means no powerful weapons.</li>
      <li>If they skipped the first zombie room, this one becomes even harderâ€”weapon spawns will be farther away from players.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Between <strong>Rooms 76 to 80</strong>, the Corpseweaver reappears. The players will flee into a <strong>metal factory</strong> with bridges, lava containers, and molten metal.
    <ul>
      <li>They must find and place <strong>4 TNT charges</strong> on the bridge.</li>
      <li>The Corpseweaver is faster than the playersâ€”ventilation shafts can be used to escape.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    After escaping, the players push forward to <strong>Room 99</strong>, facing advanced <strong>security systems</strong> from <strong>Rooms 90 to 99</strong>.
    <br><br>
    At <strong>Room 99</strong>, they must solve a puzzle to access <strong>Room 100</strong>â€”the final chamber housing the boss: <strong>Dr. Herbert</strong>.
    <br><br>
    <em>Note:</em> Fighting Dr. Herbert without clearing at least one zombie room will make the battle significantly tougher, as players will lack ranged weapons (unless lucky enough to find one earlier).
