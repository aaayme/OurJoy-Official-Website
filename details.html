    <b>General Info</b><br>
    A team of 1 to 8 players begins in the surgery room, trying to find the exit. Along the way, they must survive through 100 rooms, including 4 puzzle rooms, 2 boss rooms, and a terrifying chase sequence.

    <br><br>
    Players can collect evidence throughout their run to earn cash, which can be used to buy new abilities and starting items.

    <br><br>
    <b>Game Type:</b> Co-op Survival Horror / Puzzle Adventure
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Room Types</b><br>
    There are 3 types of rooms:
    <ul>
      <li>Normal Rooms</li>
      <li>Puzzle Rooms</li>
      <li>Boss Rooms</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Normal Rooms</b><br>
    they are randomly placed between puzzle rooms and boss rooms. Some are uniqueâ€”such as the starting room. They may be dark or well-lit, and you may encounter common monsters inside.
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Puzzle Rooms</b><br>
    Unique rooms where each one contains a different puzzle. Players must solve the puzzle to unlock the door to the next room. Some puzzle rooms may be dark, and monsters might appear to interrupt the solving process.
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Boss Rooms</b><br>
    Special rooms featuring unique boss fights. Some boss rooms may also include puzzles that must be solved to defeat the boss or to survive the encounter.
  </div>

  <div class="textBox">
    <b>Player Abilities</b><br>
    Each player has one unique ability, granted through an incomplete surgery performed by Dr. Herbert. The players escaped the surgery room before the operation was finished, so their abilities remain dormant.

    <br><br>
    To activate an ability temporarily, players must use a special item known as the <b>blue needle</b>. These needles are rare, so itâ€™s wise to save them for tough battles against strong monsters.

    <br><br>
    Later in the game, players can unlock a powerful <b>super ability</b> that requires the use of a <b>red needle</b>. Additionally, different abilities can be purchased from the shop.

    <h2>ðŸ§© Gooler's Puzzle Room</h2>
    <p>
      A lever must be activated to proceed, but it's surrounded by Goolers, making it unreachable without dealing with them first.<br><br>

      In the center of the room stands a large light tower â€” currently turned off. It requires <strong>8 batteries</strong> to operate at full power. The players must search the area to find and insert these batteries into the tower.<br><br>

      Each battery placed increases the light level, expanding a safe zone around the tower where players can rest and plan. After placing 4 batteries, Goolers will begin targeting any players without a light source or with weak lighting tools.<br><br>

      When 6 batteries are installed, the elevator to the second floor will be powered. Upstairs, players can find the final 2 batteries, along with 2 optional extras. There are also 2 small light stands that can be powered for extra safe zones â€” though activating them is optional.<br><br>

      On the second floor, be cautious â€” Goolers can emerge from the ground.<br><br>

      Once all 8 batteries are placed in the main tower, the entire room will flood with light, instantly destroying all remaining Goolers and unlocking the exit door.<br><br>

      Expect many <strong>Gooler-B</strong> types and a few <strong>Gooler-A</strong> variants throughout this challenge.
