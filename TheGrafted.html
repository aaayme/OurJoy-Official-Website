  <h1>ðŸ‘¹ The Grafted</h1>
  <p>
    This terrifying boss appears in <span class="highlight">Chapter 2</span>. After escaping underground horrors, players reach the surface and stumble into a misty graveyard. Surrounded by medieval weapons, a strange axe glows among them. Body parts begin to crawl toward it, fusing into a grotesque creature known only as <span class="highlight">The Grafted</span>.
  </p>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 1: Assembled Wrath</h2>
    <p>The Grafted uses 4 primary attacks in this phase:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Axe Slash:</b> Dashes toward a player while dragging his axe, then delivers a heavy, sweeping strike.</li>
      <li><b>Multi-Hands Slam:</b> Slams the ground repeatedly with all arms, damaging players in a line.</li>
      <li><b>Axe Waving:</b> Creates wind-based damage. Two possible moves:
        <ul>
          <li>Rolls forward, followed by a downward smash.</li>
          <li>Throws three slicing wind waves from range.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Ground Pound:</b> Slams the axe straight down, creating a shockwave in a circular area.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 2: Twisted Fusion</h2>
    <p>
      Once his health drops, The Grafted strikes the floor three times, shattering the surface. The arena collapses, sending all players and the boss into an underground fire chamber with 4 fire launchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, a <span class="highlight">plant monster</span> fuses with The Grafted, mutating his arms to stretch long distances. He also becomes immune to all direct attacks.
    </p>
    <p><b>To defeat him:</b> Lure him toward the fire launchers and trigger them while he's close. Be carefulâ€”standing too close might burn you too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    Once defeated, The Grafted bursts into flames, rolling in agony. Suddenly, a colossal <b>Skeleworm</b> erupts from beneath the arena, snatches him mid-burn, and disappears into the depths.
